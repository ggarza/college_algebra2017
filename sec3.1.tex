\section{Functions}

\textit{One of the most important concepts in all of mathematics is that of
  a function.} --T.P.~Dick and C.M.~Patton\\



\begin{objectives}{In this section, we will learn to}
  \item
    determine whether a relation is a function.
  \item
    use function notation.
  \item
    determine the domain of a function.
  \item
    determine the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two functions.
\end{objectives}


\bluebox{Definition -- Relation}{%
A \textbf{relation} in Mathematics is a correspondence between two sets.
}



\subsection{Maps and Ordered Pairs as Relations}
There are many different ways to represent relations.

\example
We can draw a correspondence between the set of states in the U.S. and a set
containing number of representatives for each state.

\begin{center}

\end{center}



This relation can also be expressed as a set of ordered pairs:\\
$\{
(\text{Alaska}, 7),
(\text{Arizona}, 8),
(\text{California}, 53),
(\text{Colorado}, 7),
(\text{Florida}, 25),
(\text{North Dakota}, 1)
\}$


\newpage


\bluebox{Definition -- Function}{%
  Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two non-empty sets.  A \textbf{function} from $A$ into
  $B$ is a relation that associates elements of $A$ with exactly one element of
  $B$.

}

\bluebox{Definition -- Domain and Range}{%
  %TODO: Write better definition of domain and range.
  From the previous definition, the set $A$ is known as the \textbf{domain} of the function.
  For each element $x$ in $A$, the corresponding element $y$ in $B$ is known as the
  \textbf{value} of the function at $x$ or the \textbf{image} of $x$.

  The set of all images of the elements of the domain is known as the
  \textbf{range} of the function.

\example
   Which of the following sets of ordered pairs describe a function?
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item  $A = \{ (-2,1), (1,3), (1,4), (3,-1) \}$
    \item  $B = \{ (-2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,-1) \}$
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Machine Interpretation of Functions}

\url{https://youtu.be/VUTXsPFx-qQ?t=213}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{3-1-lecture/001Production_Line.jpg}

Sometimes it is useful to think of functions as machines on an assembly line:
they take some input and produce some output. Like machines, functions have the
following characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    A function only accept certain things as inputs.
    That is, only numbers from the domain are allowed as inputs.
  \item
    A function is consistent.
    That is, for each input there is exactly one output.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Using Function Notation}

It is customary to use letters, such as $f$, to label functions.
We can think of a function $f$ as a process
by which each input $x$ is matched with only one output $y$.
Since the output is completely determined by the input $x$ and the process $f$, we symbolize the output with \textbf{function notation}: `$f(x)$', read `$f$ \textbf{of} $x$.'
In other words, $f(x)$ is the output which results by applying the process $f$ to the input $x$.
In this case, the parentheses here do not indicate multiplication, as they do elsewhere in Algebra.


\example
Suppose a function $g$ is described by applying the following steps,
in sequence
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  add 4
  \item  multiply by 3
\end{enumerate}
Determine $g(5)$ and find an expression for $g(x)$.
\vfill


\newpage


\example
Let $f(x) = x^2 +  4$.
Find and simplify the following.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $f(-1)$,\ $f(0)$,\, $f(2)$
  \item  $f(2x)$,\, $2 f(x)$
  \item $f(x+2)$,\, $f(x)+2$,\, $f(x) + f(2)$
\end{enumerate}
\vfill

\newpage


\subsection{Finding the Domain of a Function}


\example
Find the domain of each of the following functions.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
  $f(x) = x^2 + 5x $
  \vfill
  \item
    $g(x) = \dfrac{x-1}{x+4}$
  \vfill
  \item
    $h(x) = \sqrt{4 - 5x}$
  \vfill

\end{enumerate}


\newpage


\subsection{Sum, Difference, Product, and Quotient of Functions}

\example
We will now show that functions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and
divided.
For example, if $f(x) = 2x+3$ and $g(x) = x^2 $, then
\[ f(x) + g(x) = (2x+3) + (x^2) = x^2 +2x + 3.\]

This describes a new function which we label as $f+g$.


\bluebox{Operations on Functions}{
  If $f$ and $g$ are functions,
  operations on the functions are defined as follows.\\

  \begin{tabular}{@{}p{3.4in}l}

    The \textbf{sum} $f+g$ is the function defined by
    & $(f+g)(x) = f(x) +g(x)$ \\
    \\
    The \textbf{difference} $f-g$ is the function defined by
    & $(f-g)(x) = f(x)- g(x)$ \\
    \\
    The \textbf{product} $f\cdot g$ is the function defined by
    & $(f\cdot g)(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)$ \\
    \\
    The \textbf{quotient} $\dfrac{\rule{0.2em}{0em}f}{g}$ is the function defined by
    & $\left(\dfrac{\rule{0.1em}{0em}f}{g}\right)(x) = \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ \;\; where $g(x) \neq 0$ \\

  \end{tabular}

}

\example
Let $f$ and $g$ be the functions defined as follows
\[ f(x) = x^2 -1 \hspace{1in} g(x) = \dfrac{1}{x+2}.\]
Find the following and state the domain.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item
      $f+g$
    \item
      $f-g$, \, $g-f$
    \item
      $f\cdot g$
    \item
      $\dfrac{\phantom{i}f}{g}$
\end{enumerate}
